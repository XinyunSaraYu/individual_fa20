    "In general, my research question deals with understanding the relationship between park amenities and park popularity. The National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) asked a similar question (how can neighborhood parks attract more users?) and discussed a study on parks to find out what types of people were using parks, what amenities they used, and what factors led to more park usage (1). It was found that parks were busiest in the afternoons and on weekends, males frequented parks more than females, and adding a new park amenity (ex: tennis courts, playgrounds, etc.) was correlated with a 2 percent increase in the amount of park-goers and physical activity in the park. In addition, amenities such as walking paths and gymnasiums encouraged the most physical activity, however, walking paths existed in less than 30 percent of parks surveyed and gymnasiums in only 9 percent. Lastly, parks with walking loops had 80 percent more users than parks without; every new supervised activity added was associated with a 50 percent increase in park engagement, and marketing efforts correlated with a 62 percent increase in park-goers. NRPA concluded that marketing, investment in park amenities, and adding supervised activities may help increase park popularity.\n",

    "A report from City Parks Alliance (2) discussed how SOPARC (Systematic Observation of Play and Recreation in Communities), a park measurement tool, helped track user activity, activity types, age, gender, and ethnicity, as well as park accessibility, safety, and usability. Data was collected through direct observation and passive techniques (ex: ground sensors, cellular device detectors in benches). It was found in one study that better walking routes to and from parks could lead to dog owners engaging in more physical activity rather than driving. In another study, it was found that a park having playgrounds, basketball courts, more sidewalks, and safer intersections in the surrounding neighborhoods were all correlated with higher park use in children. Overall, through these findings, there seems to be promise that the quantity of park amenities may be associated with park popularity.\n",

    "The observations would be focused on what amenities/facilities exist in each park, how many people visit the park on a typical weekday and weekend, and the time of day in which the park is at its highest usage. I think this type of data would be able to provide some insight into whether amenities have an effect on park popularity. "
